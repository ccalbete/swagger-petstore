The load testing confirmed the Swagger Petstore API's ability to handle heavy loads effectively. The API responded promptly to requests, ensuring seamless pet creation even under increased load. This reliability is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience during peak usage periods.

The endurance testing phase was executed to assess the Swagger Petstore API's ability to handle sustained loads over a 30-minute duration. Preliminary observations indicate the API's robustness and stability during the testing period. The absence of failures suggests that the API can maintain performance under extended usage scenarios, demonstrating its endurance capabilities. This provides confidence in the API's reliability and suitability for supporting continuous operation over prolonged periods, ensuring a seamless user experience.

The stress testing phase aimed to assess the Swagger Petstore API's behavior under increasing loads. The test involved gradually increasing the number of requests sent to the API, reaching a maximum of 1000 requests. Despite the escalating load, the API consistently responded without errors, maintaining a stable performance throughout the test duration. This resilience under stress conditions indicates the API's ability to handle high traffic volumes without degradation in functionality or response times. As a result, the stress testing results validate the API's robustness and readiness to withstand demanding usage scenarios.

The security testing phase focused on evaluating the API's behavior concerning unauthorized user actions, specifically attempting to create a user without authentication. However, the test encountered an unexpected server error (HTTP status code 500) instead of the anticipated 401 or 403 status codes, indicating a potential issue with the API's handling of unauthorized requests. Further investigation is necessary to determine the root cause of this unexpected behavior and ensure that the API appropriately handles unauthorized actions, thereby enhancing its security posture.
